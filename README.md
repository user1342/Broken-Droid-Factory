<br>

BDF is a Python tool designed to spin-up pseudo random vulnerable Android applications for vulnerability research, ethical hacking, and pen testing Android app practice. 
- To get started, download the dependancies and run ```BrokenDroidFactory.py```, it's as simple as that! ‚úîÔ∏è
- Create a pseudo random Android APK that contains an assortment of vulnerable and issue prone code. üíÄ
- After run a ```README.md``` file is created detailing the app's issues and vulnerabilities. üìù 

# ‚û°Ô∏è Getting Started 
## Installation 
After cloning the repository all BDF dependencies can be installed manually or via the requirements file, with:

``` bash
pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt
```

BDF has been tested on Windows 10.

## Usage
Run BDF with Python:
```bash
python BrokenDroidFactory.py
```

Several optional pramiters can be provided to BDF, use ```-h``` to see a full list of options:

```bash
  -h, --help            Sshow this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        The output directory for the compiled APK to be saved
                        to.
  -t TEMPLATE, --template TEMPLATE
                        The path to the template app. Do not alter unless you
                        know what you're doing.
  -c CHALLENGE, --challenge CHALLENGE
                        The desired challenge level for the created APK.
  -v, --verbose         Increase output verbosity.
```

# üèÖ Types Of Challenges
Use BDF to create vulnerable and issue prone Android applications in the below categories:
- Broken Crypto: Insecure Algorithm Usage ‚úÖ
- Broken Crypto: Predictable Key Material ‚úÖ
- Exploitable Exported Activities ‚úÖ
- Insecure Data Storage ‚úÖ
- Sensitive Data In Memory ‚ùå
- Tapjacking ‚ùå
- Task hijacking ‚ùå

# ‚öóÔ∏è Creating Your Own Patchers
Patchers are used by BDF to modify a template application source and add vulnerable and issue prone code to it. A patcher must have several key aspects and have this purpose in mind. However, outside of this how patchers are implemented is quite flexible and modular.
- A patcher should be saved to the ```patchers``` directory.
- A patcher should inherit ```patcher_interface.patcher```
- A patcher should have a member variable of ```difficulty``` set to a boolean value between 0 and 10, where 0 means it provides no challenge and is used to add variability to the app, and a number higher than 0 denotes it's difficulty score to complete.
- A patcher should have a ```patch``` function that is run when the patcher is called by BDF and should return a string based on what the patcher has done.
- A reference to your created patcher class should be added to the ```patcher_list``` list variable in ```BrokenDroidFactory.py```

```BDF Pseudo Random Vulnerable Android Application Report (RumbustiousFadingness)
This README has been created as part of the pseudo randon vulnerable app creation as par of the Broken Droid Factory generation. The goal of the created application is to identify the security misconfigurations present inside of the APK.

Run Configuration
Verbosity set to: 'True'

Temlplate path set to: 'C:\Users\user\PycharmProjects\Broken-Droid-Factory/demoapp',

Output path set to 'C:\Users\user\PycharmProjects\Broken-Droid-Factory/out'

Working dir set to: 'C:\Users\user\PycharmProjects\Broken-Droid-Factory/working_dir'

Challenge level set to: '3'

App name of: 'RumbustiousFadingness'

Vulnerable App Configuration Notes
Only read the below if you want a hint on the security misconfigurations inside of the vulnerable APK- The application 'RumbustiousFadingness' has been crafted and several vulnerabilities hidden amoung it.

An activity is exported but does not have any active intent filters.

The application logs a DES encrypted password to Logcat. Find the key and identify why this is an insecure method of encryption.

A series of device paramiters are being pulled off the device and immediately encrypted. However, are they in memory long enough for the data to be dumped?``'
